<h1 id="assembly-language">Assembly language</h1>
<p>Assembly language is a low-level language that helps to communicate directly with computer hardware. It uses mnemonics to represent the operations that a processor has to do. Which is an intermediate language between high-level languages like C++ and the binary language. It uses hexadecimal and binary values, and it is readable by humans.</p>
