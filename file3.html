<h1 id="c">C++</h1>
<p>C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a generic programming language for building software. It’s an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website.</p>
